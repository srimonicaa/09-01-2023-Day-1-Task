HTTP1.1 :-

	* It uses request resources inlining for use getting multiple pages.

HTTP2 :-
	* It Works on the binary protocol.
	* It uses HPACK for data compression.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?	


	* An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. 
	* A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
	* Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as 
	  reference data-types.
	* An object, is a reference data type. 
	* Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
	* That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. 
	* The variables don’t actually store the value.

Every object has some property associated with some value.

These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.model = 'Hyundai';

myCar.year = 2020;

myCar.wheels = 4;
